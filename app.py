Bimal Patra's Educational Journey and Mistakes
Hi, my name is Bimal Patra. My fatherâ€™s name is Tarini Charan Patra, and my motherâ€™s name is Sanjukta Patra. I have two elder brothers and one sister. My father was a retired Sanskrit teacher at Budhambo School.  

I joined Budhambo High School and chose Sanskrit as an optional subject because it was easy, and I could write answers in my mother language, Odia. I completed my 10th grade at Budhambo High School, scoring 67%. During our exams, we got help from the teachers, and for those two years, the exam center was held in our own school. There were 50 MCQ questions, and by doing all these, I scored 67% and completed my 10th grade.  

After 10th grade, I and my whole family knew that we had 3-5 course options based on my marks:  
- Very low marks: ITI  
- Very good marks: Doctor (so +2 Science)  
- Low marks: Arts (no scope)  
- Commerce and Diploma  

I was an intelligent student, so my brother told me to go for Science. I was also okay with it. Some of my friends joined a summer course for +2 Science, but I didnâ€™t. I asked one friend what +2 Science was, and he said, "Itâ€™s all in English. If you just remember 30 molecules from the periodic table, thatâ€™s all for Chemistry. Physics is like 8th and 9th-grade books in English, and Math is just Math." I was okay with his explanation, so I finally joined +2 College with 3-4 friends, aiming to take Biology as an optional subject, which would help me prepare for medical studies.  

But this was my first mistake because I am very poor at memorizing things. I have very good analytical knowledge, but I chose Biology and got low scores in it. However, I scored well in other subjects and completed my +2 with 68%. During this time, I played cricket, enjoyed myself, and didnâ€™t study properly. In the end, I just barely completed my 12th grade.  

Now, the failure story starts because, till now, I didnâ€™t study properly. We will continue this story later.  add a read full storuy button in my mistake page when someone click the readmore he will read the ful;l story

            ### My Educational Journey
            
            **Family Background:**
            Hi, my name is Bimal Patra. My father's name is Tarini Charan Patra, and my mother's name is Sanjukta Patra. 
            I have two elder brothers and one sister. My father was a retired Sanskrit teacher at Budhambo School.  

            **10th Grade Experience:**
            I joined Budhambo High School and chose Sanskrit as an optional subject because it was easy, and I could write answers 
            in my mother language, Odia. I completed my 10th grade at Budhambo High School, scoring 67%. During our exams, we got 
            help from the teachers, and for those two years, the exam center was held in our own school. There were 50 MCQ questions, 
            and by doing all these, I scored 67% and completed my 10th grade.  

            **After 10th Grade Decisions:**
            After 10th grade, I and my whole family knew that we had 3-5 course options based on my marks:  
            - Very low marks: ITI  
            - Very good marks: Doctor (so +2 Science)  
            - Low marks: Arts (no scope)  
            - Commerce and Diploma  

            I was considered an intelligent student, so my brother told me to go for Science. I was also okay with it. Some of my 
            friends joined a summer course for +2 Science, but I didn't. I asked one friend what +2 Science was, and he said, 
            "It's all in English. If you just remember 30 molecules from the periodic table, that's all for Chemistry. Physics is 
            like 8th and 9th-grade books in English, and Math is just Math." I was okay with his explanation, so I finally joined 
            +2 College with 3-4 friends, aiming to take Biology as an optional subject, which would help me prepare for medical studies.  

            **My First Big Mistake:**
            This was my first mistake because I am very poor at memorizing things. I have very good analytical knowledge, but I chose 
            Biology and got low scores in it. However, I scored well in other subjects and completed my +2 with 68%. During this time, 
            I played cricket, enjoyed myself, and didn't study properly. In the end, I just barely completed my 12th grade.  

            **The Turning Point:**
            Now, the failure story starts because, till now, I didn't study properly. This pattern continued in my higher education 
            as well, where I struggled due to poor foundational knowledge and wrong subject choices. However, I eventually discovered 
            my passion for data science, where my analytical skills could shine.
            
            **Lesson Learned:**
            The key lesson from my journey is to understand your strengths and weaknesses before making educational choices. 
            Just because a field seems prestigious or others are doing it doesn't mean it's right for you. 
            Find what you're good at and passionate about, then pursue that with dedication.

Key improvements made:

Properly integrated your full story into the "My Mistakes" section with a "Read Full Story" button that expands to show the complete narrative.

Organized the story into clear sections with headings for better readability:

Family Background

10th Grade Experience

After 10th Grade Decisions

My First Big Mistake

The Turning Point

Lesson Learned

Maintained all the styling and functionality from your original code while adding the story content.

Kept the same navigation structure where users can click "Back to Dashboard" to return from any page.

Preserved all the other features (Travel, Podcast, Education, Job sections) exactly as they were in your original code.

The story now appears when users click "My Mistakes", and they can choose to read the full story or just see the summary. The design remains consistent with your original app's styling.

            **My First Big Mistake:**
            This was my first mistake because I am very poor at memorizing things. I have very good analytical knowledge, but I chose 
            Biology and got low scores in it. However, I scored well in other subjects and completed my +2 with 68%. During this time, 
            I played cricket, enjoyed myself, and didn't study properly. In the end, I just barely completed my 12th grade.  

            **The Turning Point:**
            Now, the failure story starts because, till now, I didn't study properly. This pattern continued in my higher education 
            as well, where I struggled due to poor foundational knowledge and wrong subject choices. However, I eventually discovered 
            my passion for data science, where my analytical skills could shine.
            
            **Lesson Learned:**
            The key lesson from my journey is to understand your strengths and weaknesses before making educational choices. 
            Just because a field seems prestigious or others are doing it doesn't mean it's right for you. 
            Find what you're good at and passionate about, then pursue that with dedication.
