            ### My Educational Journey
            
            **Family Background:**
            Hi, my name is Bimal Patra. My father's name is Tarini Charan Patra, and my mother's name is Sanjukta Patra. 
            I have two elder brothers and one sister. My father was a retired Sanskrit teacher at Budhambo School.  

            **10th Grade Experience:**
            I joined Budhambo High School and chose Sanskrit as an optional subject because it was easy, and I could write answers 
            in my mother language, Odia. I completed my 10th grade at Budhambo High School, scoring 67%. During our exams, we got 
            help from the teachers, and for those two years, the exam center was held in our own school. There were 50 MCQ questions, 
            and by doing all these, I scored 67% and completed my 10th grade.  

            **After 10th Grade Decisions:**
            After 10th grade, I and my whole family knew that we had 3-5 course options based on my marks:  
            - Very low marks: ITI  
            - Very good marks: Doctor (so +2 Science)  
            - Low marks: Arts (no scope)  
            - Commerce and Diploma  

            I was considered an intelligent student, so my brother told me to go for Science. I was also okay with it. Some of my 
            friends joined a summer course for +2 Science, but I didn't. I asked one friend what +2 Science was, and he said, 
            "It's all in English. If you just remember 30 molecules from the periodic table, that's all for Chemistry. Physics is 
            like 8th and 9th-grade books in English, and Math is just Math." I was okay with his explanation, so I finally joined 
            +2 College with 3-4 friends, aiming to take Biology as an optional subject, which would help me prepare for medical studies.  

            **My First Big Mistake:**
            This was my first mistake because I am very poor at memorizing things. I have very good analytical knowledge, but I chose 
            Biology and got low scores in it. However, I scored well in other subjects and completed my +2 with 68%. During this time, 
            I played cricket, enjoyed myself, and didn't study properly. In the end, I just barely completed my 12th grade.  

            **The Turning Point:**
            Now, the failure story starts because, till now, I didn't study properly. This pattern continued in my higher education 
            as well, where I struggled due to poor foundational knowledge and wrong subject choices. However, I eventually discovered 
            my passion for data science, where my analytical skills could shine.
            
            **Lesson Learned:**
            The key lesson from my journey is to understand your strengths and weaknesses before making educational choices. 
            Just because a field seems prestigious or others are doing it doesn't mean it's right for you. 
            Find what you're good at and passionate about, then pursue that with dedication.
